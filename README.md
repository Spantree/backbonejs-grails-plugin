BACKBONE.JS
===========
Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events,
collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your
existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

Usage
=====

To use backbone.js include the following in your GSP:

<r:require module="backbone"/>
